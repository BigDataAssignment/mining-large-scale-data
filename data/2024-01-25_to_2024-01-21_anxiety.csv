How can I explain to my boyfriend when I'm anxious but don't know exactly why?,"Hey guys, I'm new here, so thats my first post.

Well, I wanted some advice on the matter in the title. My boyfriend is very sweet and is always there for me. Even when sometimes I feel like I'm messing up things because I shut down. Anyway, he's very comprehensive and tries to understand and help, but he's always asking why am I anxious. Sometimes I know the reason, and sometimes I really don't, cause I feel its not one thing, its just so much at the same time. But I don't know how to explain it to him and make him understand, because in his vision I know why and just don't want to tell him for some reason. 

I would like to explain but sometimes even I have no idea what is going on. Do you have any advice on how to help him help me in this type of situation? Because he is there for me, but I feel he needs a reason so he can fix it, you know? Its just that sometimes it can't be fixed, I just have to deal with it. How can I explain it to him in a way he's going to understand and don't think I'm hiding things?

Why can’t I just be sober?,"I am 36yrs old- mom of 4 and I’ve always been on some type of substance. I was a junkie in Highschool (8yrs of heroin) and tried everything under the sun, then I moved on to drinking (2 duis later now.) I’ve tried all types of antidepressants, benzos, amphetamines, bipolar meds…I’m at a loss. I wake up everyday and my first thought is…”How can I feel different?” It runs in my mind all day long…”should I smoke?” “Is there a pill I can take” “should I try ordering meds online?” It’s like I’m just one big ball of addiction to an imaginary fix. One big ball of anxiety. I feel so bad for my kids because I’m never comfortable in my own skin. Always staring off thinking or disassociating.
I don’t laugh or play and when I do, it’s forced. I’ve been diagnosed as bi-polar, and have severe anxiety. Any suggestions? Anyone relate?

Daughter with severe anxiety,"I have a 15 year old daughter with sever anxiety. She has been working with a psychiatrist and therapist since she was 11. I feel so helpless and wanted to see if there was anything anyone could suggest that was possibly a game changer for them???

She is on an SSRI (prozac) and we just added gabapentin twice a day.

She is extremely weepy and struggles to go to school and stay present at school. Once she starts down that path it is extremely hard to pull her out of it. I feel her therapist and myself have given her tools to help when she gets to that point but putting them into practice once the anxiety hits is hard.

Would love to know any tips, suggestions, journals or anything that you think might help me help support her. It hurts me to see her struggle to much and not know what to do or how to help. THANK YOU!",2024-01-25T16:19:00,False,Anxiety

I had a adrenal gland tumor that was killing me. I’ve had it for years making me sicker by the minute. They got it removed and I have gained back the weight and can eat and I’m no longer dying!

Im in constant panic to where I feel like I’m floating out of my body and can’t feel anything, makes me feel like I’m just gonna drop.

How long before flight should I take Lorazepam?,"Hello,

I'm looking for some advice on taking Lorazepam before a flight. I was prescribed 4 0.5 mg of Lorazepam due to anxiety while flying (2 for the flight there, 2 for the flight home). I'm flying for the first time in 5 years next week and I'm kind of freaked out. 

I'm wondering how long before my flight should I take this and how much? My doctor said to take 1 pill 1 hour before my flight, and another 4 hours later if needed. My main worry is that it wont ""kick in"" by the time I'm in my seat and taking off (the part I'm worried about the most). I have a pretty high tolerance for things, should I take 2 of them an hour before?? I hate flying, but once I'm in the air and settled in, I'll be okay. Just worried about that first part where I'm buckled in and can't go anywhere and the take off itself (perfect panic attack fuel).

I have a history of anxiety/panic attacks, but I have gotten it mostly under control with therapy, breathing, etc. I've taken Xanax in the past years ago, but only short term. No experience with Lorazepam. Are they very different?

Any help or suggestions are appreciated! Thank you. ",2024-01-25T14:04:05,False,Anxiety

i looked it up not too long after, read it was harmless and then didnt really look back on it because they were very rare; maybe every few months. then 2021 hit and they came back again, this time they were a lot more frequent and it’s been a struggle ever since. i sometimes can get them 5+ times a day, sometimes i wont have any at all for a couple of days. 

i dont know what it is, but it’s driving me insane.. ive had an ekg done, ive had bloodwork done; nothing comes back. but these palpitations dont happen during the ekg so how do they even know what it is? ive been worried about dying every single day and every single second for the past 2 years. i wanna live without this fear and without these palpitations happening with every movement or emotion i have.",2024-01-25T09:56:02,False,Anxiety

Can’t keep a job,"I (F19) have social anxiety, haven’t finished high school bcuz of my anxiety and I’ve been working on and off in about two years now. The plan is to go to a special school meant for people that needs some extra help to hopefully finish high school, however I’m not sure I want to bcuz I have bad experience with school and I just enjoy working more than I enjoy doing theoretical work at school etc.

The problem rn is that I’m close to quitting my job, I feel so insecure, and I don’t know what to do, I’ve asked for help from this place that offers help for people like me that can’t keep a job in the long run, but last week they decided I didn’t need their help anymore, and now I’m at the same place I were at the beginning.

I never feel safe anywhere, I feel depressed every time I try and make it through, my anxiety is just making everything worse, I have no idea what to do rn…. I’m scared I will just quit before I even get another job.

Anyone that has ever been in this situation where you can’t keep a job for a longer time at a time? And how did you overcome it? Tips on what kind of job that might’ve fitted for someone who suffer from social anxiety?",2024-01-25T19:03:02,False,Anxiety
Health anxiety triggered by weed?,"I started smoking weed about 2 years ago. I admittedly was pretty irresponsible about it but was very lucky to have evaded any bad experiences… until recently. The other week i got a little too high, felt incredibly anxious and had a panic attack which i misconstrued for a heart attack. I went to get my heart checked and the prognosis was totally normal. The anxiety subsided for a few weeks before I later grew concerned about melanoma. Then i grew concerned about brain cancer. Im 18 with no genetic predisposition besides a few abnormal moles (which have been there my whole life and never had exposure to any uv light at all). I have adhd and have dealt with moderate anxiety before but NEVER anything like this. This is absolutely debilitating. And the irony is that i rationalize my self-diagnosis of brain cancer because Dr.Google oh-so-graciously informed me that the sudden development of anxiety/depression could signify the growth of a cancerous tumor. Ive ceased all cannabis consumption and have been clean for about a week now with no plans to return but this feeling just wont leave.

tldr: Im just looking for support. Has anyone else had hypochondria triggered by weed use? If so how long did the anxiety persist after the high? Is the anxiety im feeling a product of irresponsible cannabis intake or is it symptomatic of brain cancer. Ive also been experiencing a slew of other symptoms but they absolutely could just be extensions of the anxiety so i wont even bother listing them all.",2024-01-25T06:01:57,False,Anxiety

Many firsts today,"Today I looked at the sky without being uncomfortable, engaged in sexual actions without being uncomfortable, I drove, and cried out of sad emotions for the first time in a long while.

Hello! Maybe somewhat of a year and a half ago, my anxiety went haywire. At some point I found myself here, posting and asking questions. Ranting about everything and such. Well Im here to say Ive made some progress! I love hearing when others make progress, so I thought Id share as well. It all happened in the span of 2 hours, but I still count it all. I dont have a license, but as practice I like to drive home from work (6 minute drive). I drove only in the neighborhood since I forgot to bring my glasses, but it was still great! First time I have practiced in a while! Then when we (me and my boyfriend) got to my house, Ill spare you the details, but I was able to be comfortable throughout the whole experience! Due to old SA trauma and how my anxiety was, libido and comfort with sexual interactions went intooo a ravine. But tonight it climbed back up for a moment! We sat outside for a littleb before he had to leave. Looked up at the stars and moon. I felt at peace with the sky, instead of afraid of it for the first time in a whike. It was amazing. Fast forward to a little later, having a conversation, I cried. I cried because I felt sad. I cried for the first time in a good few months. I havent been able to cry, even if I was overwhelmed or stressed. So crying purely out of sadness felt so good. Feeling numb to the point of physical limits just sucks. But Im just happy that I made this progress. Thank you for readin. Sending positivity your way☺️🖤",2024-01-25T06:11:03,False,Anxiety

Stress senstitive for 3.5 months since panic attack.,"Hello there.

Techniques to reduce anxiety,"Hi hi!   


I would love to know what techniques you use to calm your anxiety before it gets out of hand. I always have anxiety, but can usually focus on work, or cleaning, or exercise to help calm my brain from running away. The past 3 weeks though I can't operate in my day to day. Work is suffering, and my personal life is a disaster because of it. 

&#x200B;

I tried a therapy session and let the therapist know my goals for short term and long term, but currently I needed the short term help and new techniques I could try. This was ignored and instead was 45 minutes of metaphors of turn your crisis into an opportunity. Long term, yes, I can see this helping. Short term while I am in the midst of a full panic attack and in tears - not helpful. A friend before gave me the 3-3-3 method, and that is helpful from time to time, and I told the therapist I needed techniques like this. No help from him.   


So I am here to ask the wonderful redditors, what techniques do you utilize while at work to keep your thoughts from running away?

&#x200B;

\- For those not familiar with the 3-3-3 method, focus on slow and steady deep breathing. Find 3 items in the room and think of the story associated with that object. Next focus on 3 sounds and what is creating the sound. Next move 3 different body parts, one at a time. This can help slow the thoughts and center you a little better.

Feeling like the only one who experiences this,"I've only posted on Reddit a handful of times. I am currently experiencing an anxious thought that I cannot suppress. 

Some background information.. I'm a (30f). I have been dealing with anxiety since I was around five years old. I was diagnosed at the age of 15 with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I was prescribed Effexor (150 mg ER) daily. My father and sister also have anxiety and take the same prescription that I do. I was always hesitant about seeing a psychiatrist as a teenager because in my mind (at the time, I don't currently think this way anymore) I thought that meant there was something wrong with me. So I took the same prescription that my family did and that helped me. Occasionally, I would hyper-focus on blinking, or the number of times that I would breathe. I would become fixated on that. However, with time, I was eventually able to get myself out of it.

Fast forward to June of last year...(this is relevant, I promise). I had to have a colposcopy (not to be confused with colonoscopy). I've had these done before. They are incredibly painful and cause bleeding, cramping, and discharge. The same happened this time. However, this time I suddenly became hyper-focused on the feeling down there. This led to me focusing on my bladder/urethra. I suddenly would fixate on if my bladder was full. I would later learn that fixating on this would actually cause a physiological response and cause my bladder to spasm. Over time, this has caused pain and an uncomfortable feeling. At first, I didn't realize this was psychological. I was seen in urgent care, and they ruled out UTI's and did a quick look to make sure everything was okay, physically. The provider confirmed that physically, everything was fine and that I did not have a UTI. She did note that my urethra appeared swollen. This is likely due to me causing my bladder to spasm when I hyper-focus on the feeling. 

I started therapy about a month ago, and they told me that they believe reducing my overall anxiety would help repress these thoughts. Here's the thing though..my anxiety is the same that it's always been. It has been well managed ever since I started medication when I was 15. I don't feel like my anxiety is out of control. I am just having a hard time coming out of this intrusive thought of focusing on sensations in that area/my bladder. I currently can't continue therapy until another month (due to insurance issues). I am struggling. I don't know what to do. I am feeling fine when I'm not thinking about it. If I'm physically doing an activity, walking, or doing something I enjoy, I tend to focus on it MUCH less and it's not an issue. This is what makes me confident that it's not a biological issue but rather a psychological one. 

Getting to why I posted on here.. I am desperate for solutions to get out of this mindset. I have tried meditation, yoga, deep breathing, you name it. I cannot shake my subconscious from thinking about it. I'm looking for support. Have you experienced this? What helped you come ""out of it""? The only solutions I can try are ones that don't require me to seek professional medical help (won't have insurance for another month). 

Please help. I'm feeling so helpless right now.",2024-01-25T17:26:13,False,Anxiety
Severe Health Anxiety Struggles,"(I believe this could trigger someone if sensitive to heart rate or specific health topics) This is going to be a long vent, I just can’t seem to tell anyone about it because people will just say I’m a hypochondriac (which I’m aware of) and that’s unhelpful. 
(I say severe health anxiety because that’s what my psychiatrist has labeled it as, also I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, and major depressive disorder which all play roles in my anxiety.) 

To start this off, I have cardiophobia. So I’m basically afraid of my own heart, heart beat, beats per minute, and etc. This has played a big role in my health anxiety before, and now it has returned. I had gotten a new medication, a ssri, to try and manage my MDD and GAD. There are only 3 antidepressants that work for my dna. I had talked myself into taking this medication for around 2 months before I finally did. I took it for 2 days total, first day started off with just a headache and nausea. Second day I had a resting bpm of around 120 and completely freaking myself out. Ended up going to a crappy emergency room that had someone who was a student doctor (not even a licensed one yet) on my case. He had dismissed my whole issue and instead of telling me that a high heart rate on new meds was normal (which I later found out) shot right to saying I had a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs) so this began my spiral. 
(I had a EKG done on my heart and everything came back healthy)
I had refused the cat scan with contrast in the middle of having a really bad anxiety attack that made me pace around the room and caused lactic acid to burn in my chest. He told me that “If I wanted to live I had the let the professionals do their job” after me saying that I’m too young to die (18F). 
Once I got home I was in a constant state of panic I suppose partly due to anxiety and partly due to my ptsd. I couldn’t walk without my heart rate shooting up and I couldn’t eat or drink anything out of fear for my heart rate going up. I had laid on the floor in my living room for a whole day constantly in a state of panic, until I got my test results back for my heart saying everything was fine and that (like stated before) my heart was just doing a normal thing to compensate for my anxiety and new medication. 
After reading this I was so relieved and finally calmed down, I was able to walk around, eat and drink a little, and feel slightly better. This lasted for a few days until a really bad panic attack happened (again due to my heart) where I spun in circles on the floor, threw up acid too many times to count, and the left side of my chest burned really bad for a consistent 7 hours until I finally went to the ER. Mind you I went to the ER around 6am so this lasted all night. 
Once I got there I slowly started to calm down and even got to sleep a tiny bit in the car since I had someone driving me. This hospital was amazing, the doctor and nurse actually listened to me and explained everything in detail while telling me I in fact definitely did not have a pulmonary embolism. He’s the one who explained that my heart rate was normal in my situation, wasn’t too high, lactic acid and acid reflux was causing my chest to burn, and I was just experiencing this very long panic attack due to being in a constant state of mental stress for a good period of time. Once again, I felt better for the rest of that day. Next morning it’s Christmas Day and I wake up around 5am to terrible nausea, I was going out of state in a few hours and felt awful so back to the er (since everywhere else was closed) to get anti nausea meds. They helped, I was able to eat a little bit but wouldn’t eat until I was full so my heart rate wouldn’t go up. My trip lasted 2 weeks and this whole ordeal lasted around 3. In that time frame I lost 12 pounds. 
Here I am now, still somewhat checking my heart rate and eating fairly better but I’m anxious mostly about my throat and lungs because of that first doctor even though I was told that my lungs and heart are alright. It’s a whole process to getting back to being the way I was before the medication but I’m happy I feel better now.

NEED HELP! Separation anxiety is ruining my life 😖,"I’m in a 5 and a bit year relationship and the past year my anxiety had been terrible and I really need anything that could help me get rid of it. 
We both live with our parents and we switch from house to house every week or so and we are also regular weed smokes all through this. 

A few years ago we had a  lot of time away from each other but we spent every night together and we had no problem with anxiety and about a year ago we started spending a few night away from each other as we could see the separation anxiety coming in for me and general anxiety got a lot worse. 
At first the nights apart were great we had them really often and had multiple night away and more recently it’s become once a week where we plan a night apart and it’s got to the point where I can’t even do that because the last time I just broke down panicking and I couldn’t leave him but eventually after about 15 mins of tears we decided to call for the first few mins so when I say bye he’s already gone if tha makes sense. 
And on these weekly ones we meet up quite early at like 1-3 and this is due to anxiety because before like I said we had multiple nights apart so we could only meet up for like 2-3 hours tha day. 

We have come up with spending a few hours on a few other days of the week doing sommet separate and meet back up but I am struggling to find things ti do because my anxiety is bad I hate going out in public I avoid any person I see I would also like to work on this anxiety because due to this my partner is the only person I know other than my family and this is hard. 
We are currently cutting down on smoking to help with my anxiety and trying to maintain a healthy diet and drinking plenty of water.

Psychosomatic or real?,"So, for context I've always had some anxiety issues (someone would talk to me and I would lock up, not being able to respond, speeding through stores if i had to go in alone, sit in back of class so no one could watch me from behind, very aware of how others might be seeing me and adjusting my behavior accordingly). 

Basically, these new problems start about a year and a half or 2 years ago. I basically had to cut going to the theater out of my life because whenever we'd go I'd start depersonalizing. My head would feel weird, almost like it was empty, and my vision felt like i was watching a recording or someone watching a movie in my pov. Then after that i started having to keep lights on all the time because i would see shadows moving in the dark. It didn't scare me, it would get on my nerves. Playing games and seeing something dark waving at you from your closet and distracting you was getting infuriating. 

Fast forward to april of last year. My wife and i went to a concert and had a blast. I did have to step out for like 10 minutes because it felt like my brain was absolutely fried during it. The concert ends, we get some food, and i drive the 8 hours home over night. I go to sleep and wake up and it feels like my brain is in silent hill thick fog. I can't think for the life of me. Trying to force thoughts made my brain feel like it was cramping. 

Probably about a month of dealing with that and the next phase hit me while doordashing. I had just finished my last order for the day and when i was pulling up to the light around the block from my house i got hit with numbness from my waist down. I ran the red light because i couldn't push the brake down, luckily there was no one else around. That night my wife brings up the possibility of it being some sort of epilepsy or silent siezure so i ask my PCP about it and they send me to get tests, which came back clear. 

From then on it's been nothing but downhill. My therapist gives me different medications to try, which all made me feel worse or caused panic attacks, one even causing my brain to feel like it was melting and i stared at a wall for hours (caplyta), but intuniv seems to somewhat mitigate the anxiety.  Now I'm having issues with being in public at all, riding in cars causes panic attacks, being at home can cause panic attacks, bright lights, too dark, something other than me moving my body (someone shaking their leg on the same couch as me, someone walking hard and shaking the floor, someone shaking me, vibration from a fan), loud noises, all cause panic attacks. I've also become super paranoid. I have to stare at my pill bottle the entire time im taking the pill to make sure it doesn't somehow change to different medicine. I freak out touching medicine because im scared it'll absorb through my skin, even though i know that isn't how it works. when i fill my insulin pump up with insulin im constantly sure I'm going to actually inject the 300 units into my hand, that I'm going to have a siezure even though im not prone to them and have never had one. Stupid shit like that that makes no sense. 

Since October I've had physical symptoms from it. It feels like mu body is somewhat swaying, i get hit repeatedly with awful dizziness and vertigo/tunnel vision,  i can feel my heart beat throughout my body and it shakes my body ever so slightly with every beat, I'm basically permanently depersonalized, my muscles always feel tight yet weak, my neck hurts all the time, my back hurts from bad posture because i barely have the strength to sit up, i have panic attack when trying to go to sleep, and all these symptoms get worse when i have a particularly bad episode. 

I've gone to the e.r. 4 times since October over this and they did 2 CT scans without contrast, so my paranoia about that is they didn't do enough testing to catch anything. My last visit they had a behavioral therapist come and talk to me because they thought i was a danger to myself but i explained i just want to find out what's wrong with me and he essentially said i was making it all up in my head and tricking my body into having these symptoms, which i don't think is likely because this all started happening first before i even had anxiety (to this degree) and paranoia.

I'm not asking for a diagnosis on anything, just seeing who all can relate or has any resources or info i can work with.",2024-01-25T16:57:50,False,Anxiety

Anyone else get “unscheduled event” anxiety?,"For context I actually like spontaneity when it’s fun stuff, but if something comes up that I have to “deal with” like a missed appointment, a loose filling, car battery dies, etc. it is immediate dread and anxiety.

After I’ve worked through said problem, I usually get a huge feeling of relief and again remember that it wasn’t a big deal to begin with, just stuff people deal with everyday.

I think it stems from childhood trauma (really unstable) and having to pivot when things got rough.

Me,"35 years old and have mild to severe anxiety, OCD and depression. I worry a lot and thinking so much. Simple things like traveling on the train to get to work I would have to do a pep talk to mentally prepare for. a lot people make in one place makes me nervous so I start staring In unoccupied spaces. Fidgeting. Breathe in very tight breaths. Just walk on the street is a problem as well, I usual stare on the ground while walking scared to make eye contact with people passing. If I pass a group I start walking weird like I’ve lose some control over my legs then my paranoia starts and if I pass and they all of a sudden get quite then start talking and laughing I think it’s about me.. 
I’ve lost a lot of friends because I won’t go anywhere unless I know how the atmosphere going into . I feel uneasy/uncomfortable in clubs and lounges. I have an extreme fear of looking stupid or embarrassing myself which my therapist kinda  doesn’t get. I’ve never had a boyfriend due to being weird or the fear of coming across strange. I think my only bridge to connecting to people is by being funny but even now that ability is starting to fade. I’ve started meditations 4 months ago but tbh idk if it’s doing anything aside but I lie to my therapist and say it makes me feel “even”. I never did anything fun like sing karaoke or dance on a dance because of anxiety. I don’t even know if this will ever go away or at least get to a place where it’s truly manageable. I just want to vent somewhere",2024-01-25T15:43:38,False,Anxiety

Another crisis,"Hey there, TLDR at end. 

So I’ve entered another crisis due to being completely overwhelmed with life. I do have a lot going on with work and home and was balancing ok barely but every day was just pure anxiety driven. 

Had a, don’t know what to call it, breakdown? Where I just couldn’t take anything anymore and even the slightest thing sent me into a spiral. Pulled away from everything and slipped into the void. 

I take an SNRI (duloxetine) and I have propanalol script which I use sometimes if I know a particular thing is coming up that will make me anxious. But I just don’t feel like anything works. 

I don’t really think people understand how bad it gets for me. And how quickly it goes from coping ok to rock bottom. I feel I play pretend constantly and I’m exhausted. I have regular therapy again now but he says I need to find the triggers, but how do I identify a trigger when I’m literally afraid of everything all the time. This has been my whole life.

I’m seeing my doctor on Monday. I want to talk to him about medication because I just can’t keep doing this. I can’t keep being on edge all day every day. I was on sertraline prior to duloxetine (current) and lexapro prior to that. And nothing is helping me with coping with just life and it’s surprises. Asking for Xanax here is like asking for crack. I just don’t know what to say to him to get him to take it more seriously and I’m very good at hiding how bad things really are for me. My partner is the only thing that motivates me and they try their best but again playing pretend for them. 

TLDR:
Entire life plagued by anxiety and depression. Tried lexapro, sertraline, duloxetine and propanalol. Need to know if there are other non addictive options to help on a daily basis because I’m sick of struggling every day and playing pretend it’s exhausting. What alternates worked for you? And how did you get your doctor to take your issue seriously?",2024-01-25T15:31:44,False,Anxiety
Canceled a last minute plane trip because of anxiety,"I’m a female, 27 years old with 3 children. 
My husband and I were invited on a ONE day trip across the country to hang out and my family paid for the ticket. 

We agreed to go even though we would only have one full day there. We thought it was wasn’t it the most ideal but we could make it work. We thought, “We’re still young and can do an adventure without the kids!”

Well these last two days me and my husband have been extremely irritable and stressed out over it. All I hear on the news this last week is about plane malfunctions. 

We ended up canceling plans a day before we were supposed to leave just because my anxiety has been through the absolute roof. I feel like the biggest POS and really regret making these plans to begin with.

Anxiety surrounding texting in early dating,"We haven’t been in many dates(but they have gone well from my perspective). It’s just that I’m constantly unsure in between the dates. They don’t text a lot or seem very “engaged”. Sometimes it seems like they don’t completely read everything I wrote,  but t I’m kind of nitpicking there. One could interpret this as disinterest, but I don’t think it’s the case. The problem I’m having is that I’m second guessing myself because of this. I’m not a huge texter, but not having some banter back in forth makes me feel less “wanted”. 

It’s just hard to tell whether nothing is wrong, it’s a compatibility thing, or just something I need to work on. I’ve dated people that didn’t make me feel like this… buut I also might not have been as invested/interested as I am right now. 

If she said she didn’t want to go out anymore, I might feel a little bad, but I think I’d feel better the next day than I do now. It’s hard for me to tell whether I need to just accept or if this is actually an incompatibility.",2024-01-25T15:03:10,False,Anxiety
I think I might be getting worse.,"Hi everyone. I don’t really know where else to go or who to talk to. I’m 30, live by Philly, PA. I was diagnosed with anxiety and Manic major depressive disorder about 3 years ago. Recently I lost my job due to our company being bought out by a bigger entity. I’ve never had anxiety like what I currently have and I think I just need the reassurance that I’m not entirely alone here. 
Since finding out the news that I no longer have a job, I have been absolutely sick. This started on Monday. I woke up in a full anxiety attack, heart racing, and out of breath. I immediately threw up. Throughout the day I tried to eat small things and drink ginger ale. Still threw up. Every day since I have woken up each morning the same way. I can’t tell if me thinking that there’s something else wrong with me is making me panic more, or if this whole situation really did just cause the worst anxiety I’ve ever felt. 
Has anyone else had this happen? Am I ever going to stop waking up like this? I’m scared. I’ve had mini anxiety attacks before and I thought those were bad, but throwing up every day and waking up drenched in sweat and unable to breathe is not something I’ve ever experienced, and I don’t know how to calm myself down. 😔 Thank you for reading. I hope you all are having a better week than I am.",2024-01-25T15:01:36,False,Anxiety

How to know if physical symptoms are real and not just anxiety?,"Edit: I haven't censored any words relating to sickness , so if that is a trigger for you , maybe don't read  


I have severe anxiety and OCD and it gives me physical symptoms all the time, mainly ibs-d, nausea, hot flashes, sweating, stomach pain, unable to swallow, etc. At basically all times I am experiencing one of these symptoms. Normally, all the symptoms are managable except for when I have a panic attack / ibs flare (my ibs is entirely stress related) and then I get all the symptoms very intensely at once, but then its normally over within an hour maybe two max, but today they have been really intense all day. My stomach has felt really awful, my stomach was upset but I only just took loperamide because it was managable but then it suddenly ramped up after eating. The nausea is WAY more intense that it ever usually is, I keep switching between very hot and very cold and my hands are shaking really bad. My head is pounding, too. Could this all still be anxiety? Today is my birthday and I have a lot of anxiety attached to it, and I was nervous about my birthday plans (which I ended up cancelling). Maybe its still anxiety but more intense because I am stressed about my birthday?

If anyone can give advice or insight, or even just speak about their own experiences I will be really grateful. I'm just panicking a bit because its unusual for me to feel like this. Its not helped by the fact that the loperamide and pain killers seem to be taking a while to set in, but to be fair I did only take them 20 mins ago - it just feels like its going slowly because I'm in pain.",2024-01-24T22:38:06,False,Anxiety

I will say, I’ve tried so hard to refrain from a Google search or really anything that is going to make my mind spiral. 

While visiting my Doctor yesterday, I brought my concerns about my calcium levels up. I told him that I heard it could mean a few different things, such as taking too much vitamin D, or even having low vitamin D levels? 

He informed me that it could be a sign of CANCER and that he’s not too concerned… and said that I need to cut out the vitamin D and we’ll check it again in a few months.

Yohimbine Eliminates my Anxiety,"Coming off Pregabalin yesterday, today I was supposed to be a more anxious than I usually am. Yet, this stimulant, makes me somewhat angry, pissed off, but motivated, and it wipes out any kind of anxiety or social anxiety. I feel powerful on it, like I can do anything even without a clear plan. ***It gets rid of any fear I would normally have.***

What's with the alpha-2 receptor antagonism that produces this effect? I've tried various other stimulants and supplements, and none of them do this.

**Ephedrine** gives me tons of energy, makes me happy, positive, and talkative. It's an excellent pre-workout, though it doesn't suppress my appetite like it's supposed to. Actually, I end up eating more on it for some reason.

**Modafinil** gives me focus, motivation, and helps me lock in on whatever I'm doing.

**Phenylpiracetam** was great for giving me limitless workout energy. The new Phenylpiracetam Hydrazide works okay, but it's nothing like the old one.

**Caffeine** is a basic staple in my stack. I'm always on some form of caffeine.

Something different happens when I take Yohimbine. I've taken doses up to 15mg, and today, after not taking it for a long time, just 2.5mg with 200mg of caffeine brought this amazing effect again.

I just don't care on it. It makes me overly confident. It baffles me to know that the common experience people have with this is feeling anxious and jittery. I know this can be an indicative of ADHD or something, but why don't other substances/supplements that increase dopamine/norepinephrine are able to replicate this effect?

Anyone out there with similar experiences? Have you been able to figure out the mechanism of why it does this? And if so, have you found a way to replicate it in another way?

If not I guess I'll just keep taking it.",2024-01-25T14:09:24,False,Anxiety

It can be ANYTHING, from niche magazines to astrophysics, from studying to house work. I'll somehow ruin my motivation and flow by comparing and trying to keep up, or competing with others mentally.

I feel like I’m dying at only 18,"Hello everyone.

I am an 18 year old dude who suffers from severe anxiety. I have never been “officially” diagnosed but doctors have said it’s possible I have an anxiety disorder. 

I wanted to come on here and ask for advice. I started a job at a retail store two days ago. I don’t really want to mention what store so nobody who might know me sees this. I have never had a job longer than a week. This is due to severe anxiety. I don’t know why but when I get a job, I get severe anxiety the day before I start. I get this constant feeling of fight or flight every night before I have to work. It’s awful. When I’m at work I just can’t wait to go home. I miss my family, my dogs, and I think about all the things I could be doing. I also become depressed because I feel like I spend the whole day at work even though i only work part time. It makes me feel like a robot and like there’s not enough time in the world to do stuff I like. 

Anyways, like I mentioned, I started a new job two days ago and I already quit. The job wasn’t the problem. It’s a great job actually. It early in the morning and the employees and management seem great. I got introduced to all my coworkers and it went well. It’s super easy work and I actually enjoyed it, but today something changed. I started getting really anxious and homesick. I started missing my family and my dogs. I started thinking about everything I could be doing but instead I’m working. I had a mini panic attack that I managed to get over pretty quick. I was just staring at the clock the whole shift and thinking of quitting. Well, when I got off work I quit. Now I’m kind of regretting quitting but I also keep thinking it will be a daily occurrence of anxiety attacks if I had stayed. 

The problem is I’m only 18. Everyone works and I just can’t be normal for God’s sake. I’ve quit three jobs because of this before. And the worst part is my parents had been pressuring me to get a job. Every single job I’ve quit because of anxiety, I’ve told my parents that I got fired. They aren’t big believers in mental health issues so I have to lie about quitting. This is becoming an issue and I get even more anxiety knowing I have to work for the rest of my life. It eats me alive thinking about all of this. I don’t know how to fix myself and be normal. When I work I spend the whole day dreading the hour I have to clock in. I don’t know what to do. I feel so behind compared to other kids my age. These past few days have also been horrible because I’m also sad that my dog is getting old. I can’t even look at her without crying. I hate myself so much for being this way. Please give me some advice. Thanks.",2024-01-25T07:39:54,False,Anxiety
"Help please, I'm having sudden chest pains and scared of possibly having heart problems","I 22 F , think it's a must that I have to start off by saying for the last three months I've been dealing with health anxiety, chronically looking up my symptoms online (I know, bad idea) which, as you would know, doesn't always end well.

I've been able to manage my anxiety for a while but recently it has come back after having a mild flu for only 2 days. Prior to the flu, I've had blood tests, x rays, and an ECG because of chest pains. My labs were normal, nothing alarming. My ECG detected Sinus Arrhythmia which is said to be pretty normal. My X ray however still has to be read by a cardiologist which ill be visiting on Saturday. 

Right now, I've made the big mistake of researching chest pains online and discovered Myocarditis and now I'm terribly scared of possibly getting it, especially after getting the flu which is said to possibly cause it.

I'm just tired of pretending that I don't perceive the world differently on a daily,"For my whole life I've failed to meet any expectations that've been placed on me by other people and this last year I even failed myself. People expect you to be like them, act like them, talk like them, but how can I if my brain chemistry is literally different, making me see the world and interact with it in a different way?  


I'm not entirely sure about my diagnosis, because out of a dozen doctors I've met through the years everyone had their own version of what's wrong with me - from the earliest ""He's on the spectrum"" from my childhood to ""You're showing signs of an antisocial personality disorder"" in my early 20s with a set of GAD/OCD and other common disorders ""diagnosed"" in my teen years.  


No medication worked for me beside any drugs which could tackle GABA - and when I think about it, it makes sense, since the ""low GABA - high glutamate"" is a core part of being on the spectrum. Ofc it's not the only thing but it's the main part which leads to most of the symptoms such as anxiety, sensitivity, obsessions and many more.  


Rn I gave up on looking for a ""right"" diagnosis because honestly it would change nothing so all I'm relying onto is my coping strategies, self-help and an emergency GABA pills which I'm very careful with  because of their risks of dependency. I'm only allowing myself to take the lowest dose before going to bed once in a week or two and only if things get really overwhelming for me.  


Yesterday was one of those days and I took a pill, waited a few hours for it to kick in and as usual - I once again felt like a ""normal"" human being. My sensory issues went away, sensitivity returned, even ""correct"" facial expressions started sorta coming up naturally - not the usual mask. I stopped acting robotic and tight and felt like a human being. I didn't have to follow my obsessions and ""specific interests"" - I finally felt slowed down enough to be actually able to control myself and stir the wheel.  


So I sat there and I felt fucking sad. Sad for being wired the wrong way, but at the same time being able to take a pill and fully grasp how much eaiser life is for the average folks and how basic things which usually take me weeks, months or even years to out manually can actually come to me naturally - if my neurochemistry would be right. Which is not. And it can't be fixed - the pills are highly addictive even for a common folks.  


Just a temporary relief to realize it all, go to sleep, wake up and try to carry on again - overwhelmed, anxious and with a permanently altered perception of the world and myself which cannot ever be fixed.",2024-01-25T07:23:50,False,Anxiety
Is there a reason?,"

Whenever I'm wronged or manipulated or I discover the truth about someone or their intention - in all types of relationships; friends, colleagues, family, romantic - I ruminate & I can't get over the deception, betrayal and the fact that everyhting I thought to be true was not.

My family & friends however I've noticed get over things fairly quickly, incl the big stuff. Is there something wrong with me? Am I a little bit retarded, like I havent gotten past the mental stage of a child? Or do I have some kind of personality/character disorder? Idk it doesn't feel normal. I previously thought it was because I'm an empath. But these feelings run so deep. I feel pain so deeply emotionally mentally *and* physically and it doesn't get better with time, it gets worse because of the thought that I had the whole situation completely wrong, I was saying and doing things thinking they were meaningful but in the end all of it was nothing/fake/not real. 

I know there isn't a black and white label to this, this is a grey area of the psyche where it's a myriad of things particularly as I recognise that there might also be an attachment style element as well - my parents witheld affection and betrayed my trust as a child a lot. So I get it stems from that. But why is it having a ripple effect esp as my dad left 24 years ago when I was 9 with NC and I limit all interactions with my mum cos of her NPD. 

I also always feel entitled to an explanation from these people, I feel entitled also to an apology & I also feel entitled to their feelings of remorse. Like why did you do this to me? Why do you not feel any guilt? Why? Why? Why? Argh am I psychotic?!

TLDR; the humiliation of betrayal & deception lingers for me much longer than it should. Why?",2024-01-25T13:18:56,False,Anxiety
