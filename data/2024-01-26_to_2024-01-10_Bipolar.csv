Why is the suicide of a person suffering from mental illness such a big deal?,"First: I'm not suicidal or anything I was just thinking about this question.

If someone has an organic disease and it is a certainty that they will suffer for a long time, even if they would have some better phases, then everybody is okay for putting them to sleep forever. 

But if it's a mental illness it's okay to let them suffer (in most countries). 
So why can't people accept that a mentally ill person who has suffered for like 10 years for example and who lives a miserable life decides to free herself from suffering if no doctor will do it? Why do people see this as a tragedy? Why can't they just be like ""it's better like that, he/she was suffering too much""?

I'm not talking about people who experience their first depression and have a suicidal ""raptus"" which is truly a tragedy.",2024-01-25T22:28:52,True,bipolar
I wish I would get sick and die...,"...and I feel really messed up for even having a thought like this. I keep having intrusive thoughts that I get really sick and die of a physical illness, and it gives me a sense of comfort, which then makes me feel like a terrible person.

Just searched my house with a knife,"I'm currently having a manic episode that's slowly getting worse. I was sitting in my room downstairs and I started hearing walking upstairs. I listened closer and thought I could hear muffled talking too, but I couldn't make out what they were saying. I'm home alone and this rightfully freaked me the fuck out, so I grabbed my taser and a knife and set out to confront them.

I searched everywhere for maybe 10 minutes, checking and double checking every room. Suddenly it dawned on me how fucking insane I must look, and I realized it was probably in my head. I'm just sitting here now contemplating what I'm going through. The soonest my psychiatrist can see me is in 2 weeks, that's not soon enough at all. This is only the 3rd day, I don't know how much worse it's going to get. At what point should I go to a hospital??",2024-01-26T00:22:27,False,bipolar

Finally diagnosed,Yesterday I was finally diagnosed with bipolar type 2 after years of trying to get help and being brushed off and a few admissions to the hospital.

I miss alcohol,"I'm wasn't an alcoholic by any means, but was just a Friday and Saturday night drinker and bar crawler.

Thanks to my manic episode this past November, rife with psychotic features, I'm now on Lithium and Gabapentin just to stay sane.

No more nights drunkenly singing with my friends; no more social lubricant to make new ones at the bar. No more ordering shots for friends, or having them order some for me. No more walking or Ubering to our favorite spots. No more getting drunk and watching movies with my roommates while making whatever stupid comments we could in reaction to them.

Nothing, cause of the only thing keeping me from losing my mind again, my prescriptions.

I have to sit out and stay away from that shit as to not damage my liver and kidneys any further than already medically necessary.

It fucking sucks not being able to do the one thing my friends always like to do, and now that I'm sober at all points in time it seems like I don't have much to look forward to once the weekday is over. 

There is nothing but boredom now.

How the fuck do I have fun when I'm on these meds? It seems like everything I feel is dulled and any sense of joy that I had is gone. No part of me wants to be delusional again but I'm tired of not feeling anything about anything.

Just broken up with and for once it wasn’t because of my bipolar,"I met this girl a few months ago through Hinge. We hit it off instantly. We hung out a handful of times. Our communication was 15/10. I’ve never had anything like this and she was very supportive when I’d have a manic or depressive episode. She even went as far as to do research about bipolar and even the meds that I take as she was not familiar with mental illnesses. We were perfect for each other.

She’s a CNA and was asked to do a live in position. After a few conversations weighing the pros and cons, we decided it was a good idea for her to do this even though we wouldn’t be seeing each other for an extended period of time. I won’t bore you with the details of what happened during her time there but she did become quite depressed and drained mentally and physically. She requested relief but was never sent any because they’re short staffed and her client is ‘on her way out’. 

Her communication with me became less and less and I became more and more worried about our future. After several days of her not responding to any messages. I tried callling her to see what’s going on. She didn’t pick up the phone but she did text me shortly after and told me about the things she’s going through. She has told me a few weeks prior that something that she needs to learn how to do is ask for help when she’s going through something. It’s gotten so heavy on her that she has no idea how to function and is in a deep depression. 

I won’t disclose exactly what she is going through but she did move here from Africa a few years ago without her family. She misses them and isn’t too keen on how things are going in America. Knowing that she wanted to leave broke me…I know I have no control over what she does. I’ve been so supportive of her during her time in this assignment she is on. 

The following day I did contemplate ending it all. It wasn’t just a “I think I should die because I’m alone”. But more of a meditated plan as to how I’d do it. I’ve never gotten that low before. I thought to myself I should text her. I couldn’t bring myself to do it because A) I had no idea what to say and B) if she blocked me that would’ve made things worse. Today I did whip up the courage to text her and just ask how she’s doing. As per usual there has been no response but I do feel some sort of closure. I’m still sad/angry but not as much. I also don’t let this breakup affect the frequency of me taking my meds as well. 

TL;DR Things were going amazing with gf. She took a live in assignment and it sent her into a deep depression and broke up with me because she couldn’t pour/contribute anything to the relationship.",2024-01-26T02:46:59,False,bipolar

I hate this,"2 years ago I lost my grandfather, my uncle, and a friend (20M) all in the same year. The same year my other uncle almost killed himself multiple times and has been In and out of psychosis since. Also in the same year I was in a sexually abusive relationship that spun my mental issues out of control. The next year I started college and had a toxic group around me, my grandfather fell down the stairs and I found him lying on the floor looking dead and calling 911, spent Thanksgiving in the ER for my grandad, and spent any time I had with him with him thinking I was my grandma who died in 2001, and the whole time was a blur. This year I have already sung at a funeral, my aunt has been diagnosed with leukemia that we thought was treatable and is now on hospice with days to months left to live, I have a bp diagnosis, I am in the trenches of college, my family is unsupportive, and it’s been not even a month of 2023. When does it stop. Why the fuck does the universe think that I need both bp and so much shit going on. Why can’t I just stop time and process something before something else happens. I’m so sick of this. I hate that it sounds like I’m giving people excuses when I tell them reasons I can’t do things. I’m 20. I have delt with more in my life than people 10 years older than me.

Can hypomania come with insane anxiety?,"I'm working with my care team to figure this out but it feels like there isn't any answers.

I was diagnosed bipolar 2 in the hospital after a reaction to an SSRI. However the med caused depression rather than mania... I think.

I've never had anything that matches the symptoms of hypomania or mania according to my understanding of it.

What I do have are periods of crazy intense anxiety with goal driven behaviors, agitation, lack of sleep (although I usually feel exhausted) followed by intense depression.

Does that match anyone else's experience of mania/hypomania? I'm also curious about how many people experience non-standard mania/hypomania.

I beat bipolar. Finally,"10 years ago whole in college, I was diagnosed with bipolar. Had a whole list of symptoms I suffered since a child (memory, depression, attention, issues). In school I was always the last person to finish tests, angry, mentally slow, unable to make friends, etc.  Always felt I was stupid and could never control my emotions or thoughts. People always wondered if I was high because I would zone out and not follow conversation topics. 

Now I’m running a business that makes me mid six-figures yearly. I have the dating skills to never have to worry about not finding a gf again. I motivate and inspire my close friends, whom talk to me for emotional support. I am emotionally stable and I rarely get angry. 

The key was for me to continually believe there was a way to recover. That life wouldn’t permanently be like this. 

The combination of finding the right meds and fixing my diet completely changed my life. Sounds simple but took 10 years of trial and error. I had to relearn everything from the ground up.  Learn how to socialize, express myself, build habits, be consistent, etc.

Keep trying. You never know what may happen.",2024-01-26T02:39:41,True,bipolar

What scares me even more is that this certain psychiatrist prescribed me lamotrigine right away as well. I put off taking it up until now where I've been at my lowest ever in my life. I feel like there's no hope for me, and even though I really do want to take it- I'm still really terrified that I am not bipolar. (I am also scared of developing SJS or ""the rash"" from the lamotrigine as well). I apologize in advance if my fear seems really dumb, but I feel like it's valid nonetheless.

anyway. for a few years i was numb. i don’t remember much in those times. i think maybe in those times i was normal. or maybe i just gave into the worser side of things. i was irritable and often angry and i felt everyone hated me and i hated everyone. but then everything came back. nightmares. religious ones. dreams more vivid than real life. dreams more real than real life. i think i met a man who is my mirror twin flame soulmate i told him i am often temperamental and he said oh but “you’re not bipolar right?” and laughed it off and i sat there silently because well… well…. i can’t say no. and i think it is because some part of me knows. i haven’t talked to him in six months but there is some part of me that starts to believe we are the same person and that everything he is doing is everything i am doing and that i can literally feel him. i can.

what would happen? at what point an episode would begin? 24 hours? 48? after repeating this cycle twice, thrice? what episode would come first? would i get a mixed episode? how soon would psychosis come? would i die in two weeks? of course no one can answer these questions with certainty, not even my shrink, but it's fun to fantasize!

Told my girlfriend I was suicidal now she wants me to leave,"She says it’s for her sons (he’s 3.5 years old, from a previous relationship) well being as well as my own mental health. 

I just feel like an utter failure. We’ve been having some problems since I’ve been depressed. Her sons picked up on my unhappiness and acting different around me. 

So she’s requested I take my things and move out of our apartment but is telling me we aren’t breaking up. I honestly don’t know what to think about that or believe her. 

I know she has to think of her son’s wellbeing first but it hurts that my partner can’t be there for me either. 

I chatted with 988 the other night cause I knew I couldn’t talk to her because she’s overwhelmed with being sick with what we thought was Covid, she tested positive the other day and negative yesterday,and has her own issues to deal with but I just don’t know how I got here. 

It was helpful being able to reach out to 988 but I can’t help but feel alone otherwise. I can’t talk to her and my best friend is just busy with his own life and it’s long distance. 

I have till Friday to move out till then she’s staying with her son’s father and girlfriend. I’m currently now sick and don’t want to jeopardize my dad’s cancer surgery on Friday by getting him sick. 

He’s my rock and I’m so afraid I’m gonna lose my dad. There’s just so much going on in my head. 

I don’t want to die and make my parents and girlfriend feel like they’ve failed me. But I don’t feel like living anymore either. I just can’t keep a relationship or a job because of this crappy mental health issues. 

I’m debating on quitting my job that I’ve had for almost a year and a half I dread going in. I keep calling out. I feel like a terrible employee but at the same time they’ve denied my work injury claim so it’s not like they care about me either.

I’m keeping my partner updated and we agreed to one $40 purchase of some blouses for work this month. 

I’m suddenly super fixated on these operationalizations of fashion and expression and using them to analyze myself and see what would be the “best” things I could wear. 
This is also a bit piggybacking off my hair hobby, which began in October, and has culminated in me cutting my giant mane into a chic bob so I can regrow healthier after dying over dye over dye for 8 years. My brain now contains so much knowledge on type 2c-3a medium porosity normal thickness curls I could write my own wiki. I also *did* wrack up $300 on an Ulta card at the end of 2023 over this. 

Here’s the important thing though: before this, I chose to be all grungy e-girl. Cheap fast fashion sundresses or oversized graphic tees, minimum effort put into the giant mane I mentioned before, and huge eyeliner. For work I’d put my hair up with scrubs and no makeup. Now I’m suddenly cutting my hair into something high maintenance, doing makeup for my season and face shape, and spending all this time on the soft dramatics sub.

I’d like to have a meaningful job that challenges me but I also feel like my brain hasn’t been challenged for so long now idk what I’m capable of. I can’t do service jobs (fast food or any restaurant work) or anything to do with transport/driving. I do have a university degree. Has anyone been in this situation and how did you combat it/where are you now?,2024-01-25T12:41:51,False,bipolar
Brain on fire - what should I do?,"I spoke with a duty worker today which was real rough shit because my psych team has been jerking me around about my med review, so I hate them and the meds they gave me before with a passion.

Side note: I think it’s kind of funny that I had to take their meds for a while cause I couldn’t sleep and maybe it’s a coincidence but I could sleep fine before they gave me that shit.

I want to do stuff, because theirs this kind of buzzing in my brain but I’m built of weak shit and can never run fast enough or work out well enough and also does anyone know how to get into a work out routine?

I’m looking for suggestions on things to do while I wait for my brother to get here (I’m kidnapping him to watch films with me) I want to start a creative project but I can’t write poetry because I’d want people to read it and like it but I’m not popular like that haha.

Any suggestions? And idea? Advice?

I’d accept anything but drinking and drugs because I’m trying to turn my life around in that front no matter how much I don’t really want to - still smoke like a factory though, I’m single handedly responsible for 12% of the worlds pollution or something (that’s a joke, I’m very much pro recycling)",2024-01-25T16:27:14,False,bipolar
I got bipolar tattoo,Have thought of getting it for many years. But it’s taken me a lot of time to come to terms with my diagnosis.

A poem that I wrote with whats left from my brain 5 minutes ago,"The pieces that spread
To all possibilities which exist
At one place and any place
The sharpest one makes its place as it
Has more gravity towards my existence
Choking and spitting the dark matter
Tears consist little dots
That spell my screams
And last bit of my will to live
Its not me that I see in the mirror
Its an empty shell of a body
I am not even aware of what I see
Or how it started and how much it messes me
The pieces that I cannot collect
To understand what is left from me
The voices say ""how about you jump under the subway""
The thing is sometimes my feet obey
I am in the subway that was supposed to end me
Going to the work, as any adult does
Weather is cold today, minus 8 degree
The pain is worse than my trembling body

It's just out of intellectualism ik, my native language is not English. But I hope someone understands me.",2024-01-25T07:14:34,True,bipolar

Lingering sadness,"I had one of the worst depressive days of my life yesterday. I nearly took myself out at work in the bathroom. Now I'm feeling a bit better (thanks support systems) but I still have this lingering sadness. Like I made my mom cry when I admitted to her how I felt and what I wanted to do to myself and I feel bad I did that. Just a general pain, it's dull.

THREE AM,"I can’t sleep…my heart is beating out of my chest…I can’t breathe. I can’t think…I’m scared. I don’t understand what’s been happening to me. I can’t relax…all the time I feel restless, like I’ve made some mistake I need too correct. I get this feeling…makes me want to cut; so I do drugs and I drink. I have at least 10 instances of self harm on my body and several are burns. I’ve just been diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2.  I can’t tell what’s real and I never could. Only knowing that everything I do is for the right reason. I’m not going to hurt myself. I start my prescription tomorrow. It’s only that I can’t talk to anyone about this in real life. I’ve lived like this…for years now, with only my mother knowing I experience at times: catatonic depression. Everyone I know always assumed I was ""normal"" and apparently, I’m high-functioning. The truth is I am ""normal"" in a way. I’m an accomplished young person living in a metro area with a lot of support from friends and family. A year ago, I had none of that. Except, who I am now I only became so they wouldn’t lock me up in the hospital lol. It amazes my psychiatrist: that I am able to do the most easily expected of tasks like keep a job, or have a social life, or not get drunk and high all day—everyday. I tell her it’s by will, alone.",2024-01-25T09:33:55,True,bipolar
On the phone with no one,I have no friends or family to vent to. I use to trama dump with ever one when I was spiraling. The other day I pretended I was on the phone with someone. Not very long. But it calmed me down. Could this be harmful if I keep doing it? Does anyone else do this? I want to get it out without anyone including my therapist knowing my business.

Psychologist wants me to go to the hospital,"I told her I was having suicidal thoughts a few nights ago and she wants me to go to the hospital. Picked an assessment place to go and wants me to go now. But I don’t feel suicidal right now, and haven’t since that night. I don’t think I did a good job of telling her that. She’s going to call me later to see if I went. I’m still in a depressive episode but not feeling that way at all, it was just that one night that it was really bad. I do NOT want to go to the hospital again if I’m not actively feeling that way. It’s miserable and can feel dehumanizing to be treated like a kid in there with no rights. She said she thinks I should get on disability because I haven’t been able to hold a full time job longer than 3 months in the past 2 years and going to the hospital will help with that too. 

I just want to know, will she have me forcefully admitted if I don’t go? If when she calls me later I make it clear I don’t feel that way now? That I’m not a danger to myself? I don’t even know if she’ll believe me.

EDIT: I have decided to go as the thoughts have been coming back. I didn’t say this in the original post but I had made plans and that’s why she’s pushing me to go, along with disability reasons. I don’t want to go because the past two times I’ve gone I’ve been there a week and it’s miserable. But I need to go so I will. Thank you all for your advice. ",2024-01-24T22:05:10,True,bipolar
A patched up thing,"I was kicked from reality because I didn’t fit in anymore. The machine decided that I was malfunctioning. I was promised a refuge. Instead, I was altered. They stuffed me full of meta machines and watched as I changed. They made me a mirror. Now I just reflect everyone I see. They made me blank. Even if I explain that the machine is changing me, all they see is a broken part in need of fixing. Should we really fix what’s been made in nature? Who’s to say that this isn’t part of the human experience? This isn’t an illness. It’s nature. I will never take your machine again. #imanomad",2024-01-25T07:38:23,False,bipolar
Bipolar and sexuality,Is anyone with bipolar disorder 100% straight or has a manic episode and hyper sexuality led to experimenting with the same sex?

Any bipolar artists?,"Got diagnosed with unspecified bipolar earlier and I can say my meds are definitely working. At first they weren’t really working and I was still manic and made some bad decisions so I reached out to my psychiatrist and she told me to up my dosage with one more pill and I can say that my spending impulsivity is still there but I’ve definitely chilled out on all the other weird hypomanic shit I was doing. 

Maybe I’m being dramatic but I feel like the best art I’ve made was while I was feeling up, the colors were brighter I was so into making art and would just sit for hours and be able to create meaningful pieces but every thing just seems so much duller now on meds, colors aren’t as bright and it’s harder to find inspiration. 

Does anyone else struggle with this, my art is important and I want to continue to make art but I will not go off my meds to recreate that feeling I felt when I was unmedicated. If you’ve dealt with this is there any advice on how to deal with this?",2024-01-24T21:53:20,False,bipolar
Paranoia?,"I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in February of last year. This week I've been struggling hard. I've gone from super happy to super low to extremely numb. I'm currently not medicated because I can't afford it, the psychiatrist visits are expensive and I don't have healthcare but anyway. I recently rejoined TT ( I know curveball but it is important). I go through periods of liking TT to not. Everything was going great I love FN gameplay TTs and then all of a sudden I kept getting true crime TTs on my FYP. I love true crime. I've never had issues before. But I've noticed I'm stuck in a heighten mode of anxiety and paranoia. And I don't know if it's a bipolar thing or if I'm just sensitive rn ( I'm very empathetic.),I have never experienced this before. I get paranoid over health things, but I am constantly feeling like my life is in danger, and it's starting to piss me off. I wake up at 5:15 for work, and I've begun hesitating leaving my house because the backyard is super dark, and my brain is convinced someone's there.

Depressed Episodes and Anxiety?,"Is it common to feel increased levels of anxiety during a depressive episode? I know it’s something that might generally be associated with manic/hypomanic episodes, but when I’m in a depressive episode I feel anxious and unaccomplished to the point that mental blocks are created.

I was just diagnosed today. Psych said to take Seroquel every night.,"I feel like it was good advice and prescription because Seroquel does help. It just doesn't stop the thoughts. I feel like mentally violent even if I take it every day. I still had the motions, but at least I've started for that reason. For reference I took it every day that I was sober. Which ended up being like 3-4 weeks at a time. Makes sense. I just thought there would be something else to take.

But I finally got diagnosed with *some*thing. I always knew there was something but whenever I go to the docs I'm feeling fine, because if I didn't I wouldn't go to the doc. So I usually lie, ""yeah everything's been pretty okay"". Which is basically me screaming it isn't okay but what are they gonna do? It's up to me to be honest abouty emotions and when they hit.

My big thing is paranoia. Not about hallucinations but about like.. sometimes I'm convinced I know what someone is thinking and I act in that fashion. Until I find out they didn't think that at all and I just made it up. Then I find myself defending it by saying this action or that action caused me to act that way when I was only just mind reading.

So depressed I can't keep my eyes open,I'm so depressed I can barely stay awake until my son's bedtime. I can't afford to be this depressed because I have shit I have to do and will be treated badly if I'm not able to complete the tasks expected of me. I had a 3 hour nap earlier and I'm still so tired that I feel like I've been drugged. No idea how to manage this. The antidepressant I'm on is paxil and that only helps my anxiety. Tired of taking all these meds and still feeling bad. They started me back on a low dose of lithium to help the SI thoughts. I don't care about anything anymore and I'm tired of living like this.
