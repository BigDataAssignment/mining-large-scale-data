    "## Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Each framework will be tested against these 2 requirements:\n",
    "1. **Sentiment Analysis** and its various nuances, with specific focus on mental health.\n",
    "2. **Severity of Mental Health** if it's dictionaries, lexicons, or general architecture can operate on this domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media.\n",
    "It can be used to analyze the sentiment of Reddit posts (OPs) to infer mental health indicators, although with some limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. VADER provides a compound score that combines the positive, negative, and neutral scores of a text.\n",
    "2. It might identify negative sentiments, which could be indicative of poor mental health - but it's not a Mental Health tool and won't capture complexity or expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "VADER has a compound score as unidimensional measure of sentiment for the post's text:\n",
    "- positive sentiment: compound score >= 0.05\n",
    "- neutral sentiment: (compound score > -0.05) and (compound score < 0.05)\n",
    "- negative sentiment: compound score <= -0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "###  LIWC-22\n",
    "\n",
    "Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) is the gold standard in software for analyzing word use. Sadly it through paid licenses only.\n",
    "\n",
    "AFINN is a sentiment analysis tool specifically designed for analyzing the sentiment of texts, particularly those found on social media platforms. Here's an overview of AFINN, its scoring mechanism, and its application in the context of social media and mental health analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "### AFINN\n",
    "\n",
    "lexicon with each word assigned a sentiment score. Scoring is context-agnostic and not nuanced. Good for online slang, not for mental health domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Word and text aggragate scoring.\n",
    "2. Scoring is context-agnostic and not nuanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "AFINN has a simple scoring:\n",
    "- positive sentiment: compound score >= 3\n",
    "- negative sentiment: compound score <= -3\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text Blob\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-trained model on large datasets for sentiment, its a black box.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. TextBlob's sentiment analysis provides two scores: `polarity` and `subjectivity`.\n",
    "2. The model is not related to mental health nor social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Polarity**: It ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a negative sentiment, 1 indicates a positive sentiment, and 0 indicates neutrality. Polarity is calculated based on the presence and combination of positive and negative words in the text.\n",
    "- **Subjectivity**: This score ranges from 0 to 1. A score closer to 0 is more objective, and a score closer to 1 is more subjective. Subjectivity here refers to the expression of personal opinions, emotions, or judgments in the text, as opposed to factual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Empath\n",
    "\n",
    "Empath is a text analysis tool that works by identifying and categorizing words and phrases in a given text into different human-understandable themes or categories.\n",
    "If is **different** from others, because it covers a broader range of over 200 categories such as sadness, anger, family, violence, medical_emergency, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scores by Category. When you pass text to Empath, it analyzes the text and maps the words and phrases to its predefined categories. Each category contains a set of related words and phrases. For example, the \"anger\" category might include words like \"angry\", \"fury\", \"rage\", etc.\n",
    "2. Very flexible, can be applied for mental health and reddit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoring:\n",
    "- Empath counts the occurrences of words and phrases in the text that fall into each category. The score for a category is the count of these occurrences. If a piece of text does not contain any words related to a certain category, the score for that category will be zero. This count is normalized accroding to document lenght.\n",
    "- Scores have to be interpreted or copmared to a baseline."

       "(array(['Alaska was really cool.  I was pretty young since that\\'s where I started school, but I remember that the sun was ALWAYS up during the summer (I had to put newspapers over my windows because it\\'d look like morning when it was midnight), and it was always night during the winter(which made for fun school days).  We had moose hanging out in our backyard all the time.\\n\\nLol I went with computers since it\\'s the only other thing I could think of that I like/am really good with.  My family sees me as the computer fixer: whenever someone\\'s having issues, they come to me.  So I knew right off the bat that I wouldn\\'t have too much trouble getting into computer in college.\\n\\nBack in high school, I had the same person that I have now.  Her and I have been best friends for over 6 years now XD  It\\'s really nice talking to her, but I always worry that she\\'ll get tired if I came to her too much.  As you can see, I can chat people\\'s ear off if given the opportunity.\\n\\nShe\\'s literally the only person I talk to on a daily basis.  She\\'s also one of the few I can engage in a worthwhile conversation with.  Most of my other friends only like small-talk.  But I feel as if I make any mistake, I\\'d be screwed.  She\\'s much more forgiving of me than I am of myself, so my worrying is irrational.  If only I could just stop XD\\n\\nMy parents getting involved was for the better, and looking back, it was good that I told them.  I was more immature then than I am now, so having my parents as a \"leash\" did help (even if I wouldn\\'t have admitted it back then).  I only saw the psychiatrist once because I convinced him I was fine.  I don\\'t even remember what I did to get out of that, but it worked haha.\\n\\nNot even close to an only child; oldest of four.  I find fun in being the oldest all the time lol.  How about you?\\n\\nMy depression went away back then when a few close friends that I had made at the time gave me suggestions as to what goals I should set, and then I made some friends with underclassmen when I became a junior.  I became a leader in our band and got more involved in school activities.\\n\\nI should be doing the same goal setting now, but it\\'s been different.  I haven\\'t done any college activities because I knew I was going to transfer to a different school.  I don\\'t know what to expect now that I\\'m going to be living on my own.  I think my depression will be cured when I join a club or two when I go to the new university.  Now would probably be a good time for me to look up what clubs there are, and regaining my hobbies XD\\n\\nLol I wish I could stop thinking sometimes, but I have no control at all.  I hear meditation is effective, (doesn\\'t really sound like it would be), but I\\'ll give that a try.  You sound like me with the walls haha.  I feel like I put so much work into putting em all up in the right places, that tearing them down would be ruining my effort XD They get in the way sometimes, but they do good too, or else I would\\'ve never built em in the first place.\\n\\nWhen I look through this, I feel like a lot of my problems would be solved if I wrote down and kept track of everything.  Then I could turn my crazy goals into mini, realistic goals; and I would have an easier time keeping track of my schedule (I can get really disorganized; forgetting homework, etc).  Then it piles up and I get mad at myself for procrastinating.  It was pretty easy keeping everything organized in my head back in grade school, but now that I\\'m in college and out in the real world, using my memory won\\'t cut it.  I suggest you do that too, if you don\\'t do it already lol.  Days get really hectic and I\\'d have more time to relax if I just wrote what I needed to do down each morning XD\\n\\nDo you know what caused your depression?  Was it like one problem at first, that kept on becoming other problems you can\\'t manage?  I can\\'t imagine being depressed from 8th grade all the way to now :/  I was the one who came initially for help, but it feels unbalanced if I\\'m doing all the venting.  You don\\'t have to talk if you don\\'t want to, but you\\'re welcome to if you\\'d like.  I\\'m more than happy to listen to someone who\\'d do the same for me :P',\n",
       "        'I\\'m not american (assuming you are) so I can\\'t say too much about school but from what I am reading you have a lot more successes in life than \"failures\". As someone who is out of high school, all I can say is that I wish I had taken as many extra curricular activities as you. Regardless of the stress they may induce, I am sure you have learned and gained a lot from those experiences that will stick with you for life, even if only in some small way. In this way I can see you have succeeded at taking opportunities that many, myself included, will regret missing out on. The value of your hard work is not hinged on your future study prospects. You have had an incredibly successful high-school career that you should take great pride in, so congratulations. Your hard work is not a waste. \\n\\nHad you the option to choose among this specific university or the partially funded others, would you find them both worth considering? There is value in all education, and what you get from it is what you put in. Given your previous experience and hard work I should imagine you would find success in whatever you do. You already stand to gain much more as a result learned dedication than you otherwise would. \\n\\nBeing openly gay comes much easier to some than others. I myself will be open amongst certain people, yet for all intents and purposes straight among others. I also am absolutely horrible at responding to texts, however this is to all people so with your boyfriend it may very well just be a personal difference. The best advice I can give is to make the most of opportunities to talk in person. Communication is a skill that needs much practice and takes a long time to improve. If you are as open about your concerns as you can be (in a non confrontational way) it will become easier for the both of you to discuss issues like this without worrying about upsetting the other person. Just remember to talk about what you like about each other as well :)\\n\\nI\\'m not sure how helpful any of this is, but overall as cliché as it may sound: stay positive. You are neither a success or a failure. Your life will consist of many experiences, some good, some bad. How successful you are depends on how much you focus on one category or another. One loss does not cancel out your previous good experiences, so focus on them and acknowledge them over the bad ones. \\nAlso remember that you are allowed to feel sad when things do go different to expected. Try not to get upset by the fact you are upset (if that makes sense). Accepting your own feelings help you to accept the situation and move on, so be disappointed if you need to - its normal. But afterwards, add it to your life experiences and move on, your path may be different but you have plenty of life to live. In twenty years you could be somewhere great that you could never have predicted, so maybe things don\\'t need to go according to plan. In fact, when is life ever predictable? \\n\\nAt the end of the day, this is all just text on the internet. It can only help so much so if you need to talk to someone, it can help tremendously. If you have access to a therapist, it may be worth giving a try, or else anyone you feel comfortable with. It could be your family, your boyfriend, or even his family if you feel close enough. I don\\'t know how helpful this has been but I hope that sharing your problem and having it acknowledged has helped lift some of the weight off your chest. Feel free to reply or share anything else that\\'s on your mind, or just express yourself some more. I can\\'t guarantee any life-changing advice, but you will be listened to :)\\n\\nHave a great day, and try to focus on what you have going good for you. I imagine that your boyfriend still makes you happy when you do talk, so remember that and keep working on it.',\n",
       "        'Hi OP,\\n\\n(I am on my phone so apologize for typos or formatting in advance!)\\n\\nYou are being very very mature about all of this. Props to you.\\n\\nIt can be very scary to return to the real world after a hospitalization and its normal to sometimes feel like you\\'re not ready yet to return. Give your prescriptions a chance to work and most importantly make sure you are seeing someone.\\n\\nIt seems like you have a supportive mother and that is great. Absolutely tell her if you feel the urge to self-harm or feel suicidal or even if you begin to have thoughts. Yes, this may lead to another hospitalization but dont worry about that! the important part is absolutely to get help and tell an adult! Especially if you feel like your mood worsens or if you feel like you start to have any new symptoms (racing thoughts, feeling super super happy in an abnormal way, anything that deviates from your normal!!).\\n\\nI worked as a direct care worker with teenage girls aged 13-18 in a residential program. Many of these very strong girls struggled with depression and were hospitalized and came to us as a transition before going home. We helped them learn how to cope with stressors in their environment and how to substitute \"harmful\" behaviors such as cutting with positive self-control strategies. With this in mind, I will try to give you some pointers (this isn\\'t perfect as you really really should be working with a professional on these! But I figure you can at least get started on your own!):\\n\\n- First, consider journaling. Whenever you feel upset, write about how you\\'re feeling and most importantly try to explore WHY you feel that way. Was there anything that set you off? When you\\'re upset, what does that look like? Can you notice any patterns? Are there any thoughts you repeat to yourself that you know aren\\'t true but can\\'t help but feel like that? Do this if you feel like self-harming or have any suicidal thoughts too! The point with journaling is this: try to find your triggers so you can learn how to counter them and also to help you identify thoughts and behaviors that may be the \"depression\" talking (guilty thoughts or thoughts about how you\\'re worthless for instance) and finally to help you notice any patterns in sleep or eating and whether your meds affect you!\\n\\n- when you feel the urge to self-harm, DON\\'T. It will be hard. But instead, try to use something else. Make a list of things that help make you feel better when you\\'re upset: dancing, singing, painting, sports, writing, reading, music (please avoid sad/depressing songs while you\\'re upset! You might feel like it helps but it could do the opposite!), etc. when upset, revert to this list! Most importantly, if you\\'re at the point of thinking of self-harm, do one of the following: chew on ice, take a cold/hot shower, throw ice cubes at a wall, freeze an orange then roll it around in your hands, or wet a small towel and freeze it all twisted up then try to untwist it. These are all sensory things that might help you get through the urge to self-harm.\\n\\n- last but not least, use a process called thought stopping. Whenever you find yourself spiraling into bad thoughts (I suck, life isn\\'t worth it, I should just kill myself/harm myself, etc) literally think or even say out loud STOP! Then, consciously think of something else or go journal or go use one of your list from above!!! The idea here is to help you become more aware of yourself and to help stop you from getting to that point.\\n\\nPhew sorry for the long post! I won\\'t use a TL;DR because this is all very important. I hope this helps you! Once again, please please find a psychologist you like and attend faithfully!!! There is really nothing better to help. The meds will help, certainly, but a psychologist will make sure you know how to help yourself! And that will last you a lifetime.\\n\\nFinally, please if I can help you in any way feel free to PM me. :) I wish you all the best and know that it absolutely does get better! The adolescents I worked with are all real world examples of this!! :) I am confident you will be another one of these examples!!! Much luck to you and work hard. Take care.',\n",
       "        'It\\'s easy to feel when you are down that you would be a weight on anybody that you talked to about it.  Try mentally turning the situation around though, what do you feel like when people open up to you with their problems?  How much strain do you experience hearing about their struggle?  Do you feel any compensating factors?  In particular I have in mind two major examples: the relief in the knowledge that these struggles are a shared human experience, and the opportunity to make something positive out of the pain you have experienced in your life and that you know the other person is going through.\\n\\nMy day is better for being able to talk to you, not worse, and I hope you will find the same of me, *hug*.\\n\\n&gt; I get it. Get out of your own box and see outside the box. I know, that easy, right? I know what to do. Focus on work, you\\'ll feel better. But why can\\'t I just do it?\\n\\nThis question of \"Why can\\'t I get myself to just do these things that I know are good for me?\" has bothered me for a long time.  That question has lead me on a lengthy search ending up in a research topic called \"behavioral design,\" partially targeted toward marketing companies that want you to buy or use a particular product obsessively, but also partially targeted and particularly useful for making effective life changes in your own behavior.  In any case, this is what has finally really worked for me.  Googling for \"behavioral design\", \"tiny habits\" and \"BJ Fogg\" will turn up lots of info, but here are the highlights:\\n\\n* **Motivation** is important, but honestly if you have gotten this far, you already have a lot of motivation to make your life better.  Motivation is the one of the hardest things to change in behavior anyway, so don\\'t spend your effort here until you\\'ve exhausted the other two items.\\n* **Ability factors** are easy to affect and are often overlooked until you sit down and analyze the problem.  The simplest form of this is to make the task simple... ridiculously simple.  Want to start flossing?  Floss one tooth.  Want to start running every morning?  Put on your running pants.  Want to read more?  Pick up a book and read one sentence.  The key once you have done these things is to then *celebrate* the fact that you successfully completed what you set out to do.  Take time, acknowledge it, and then if you feel like doing more, go for it.  If not, come back and succeed at the same task the next day which you can totally do, because you\\'ve reduced the difficulty of the task to almost nothing.  The things you have retained though, the combination of an action, successful completion of that action and celebration of that success, are all very effective in establishing behavior change.  The full on behavior that you are looking to achieve will grow naturally out of what you have seeded if you give it enough chance to do so.\\n* **Triggers** are massively important.  The are so fundamental to behavior that no behavior ever occurs without a trigger event.  The interesting thing here is that they are so deeply built into the way we live our lives, they can be hard to even see sometimes.  For example, I make a pot of coffee every single morning, that\\'s a behavior.  What\\'s the trigger?  I make coffee after I take my vitamins, and so taking my vitamins is the trigger for making coffee.  It seems trivial, but these chains of event triggers guide us invisibly through most of our waking hours.  The cool thing is that it\\'s pretty easy to setup new triggers.  A sign on the bathroom door will remind you that you want to do a (single) pushup every time you want to go to the bathroom.  A note on the coffee pot reminds me that I decided that every morning after I make my coffee, I want to close my eyes and take a deep relaxing breath.  Setting my homepage to my morning log that I fill out every day reminds me that this is the first thing I do every time I turn on my computer in the morning.',\n",
       "        'I didn\\'t suggest you should not care.   I didn\\'t suggest that you should say \"fuck it\".   Or walk off.  Or abandon them. \\n\\nIt is one thing to care. It is another thing to own it, to feel responsible, and for you yourself to be stressed that YOU are not solving the problem. \\n\\nCaring is fine, caring is good.  Feeling responsible is not. \\n\\nWhat CAN you do?  You can be available to talk. You can empathize. You can be patient. If you have particular insights, you can offer those to them. Other than that, these are adults and they are responsible for their own lives. \\n\\nI am not getting the words quite right, but I hope you get the idea. There\\'s a line between care and responsibility. \\n\\n------\\n\\nI\\'ll give you a specific example. I have a friend who abuses drugs. Not all the time.  But sometimes. And he gets into trouble doing it. This is an adult, someone who \"ought to know better\" or whatever.  And intellectually, he knows the drugs are not good. And yet....  He still does them.  He still goes back to them, from time to time, when he\\'s feeling good, and when he has cash to burn. He still talks himself into doing stupid destructive things. \\n\\nWhen he is drugging, he does things that are mean, hurtful, and dangerous. (beyond being criminal).  It\\'s not good for him or the people around him. \\n\\nWhat can I do about this? \\n\\nI *care*.  I do.  Very much. I want only good things for this guy.  I see a path that is better for him. He has all these good things going for him. But I cannot NOT DO DRUGS for him.  He has to make that decision.  He has to do that thing, for himself. \\n\\nI talk to him, sometimes about the drugs, but mostly not. I talk to him about anything, I do stuff for him, work on his motorcycle for him, gratis.  I do favors for people he loves, only because he is my friend.  I spend time with him when he is not drugging, and just try to share good things in life, good times, you know? Like going fishing or just going out for a pizza and to watch a game on TV. Or talking about a cool book I read. I try to inhabit the part of his life that is good and drug free, I try to enlarge or enrich that part of his life. \\n\\nBut I cannot babysit him. I don\\'t call him every day and ask \"did you say no to drugs today?\"  \\n\\nI step away from him when he is drugging, because... honestly, it\\'s not my problem. I have my own things to deal with, and I know he can\\'t solve MY problems either.  We both know this.  We\\'re both clear on the lines of responsibility.  I care, but his problem is not my problem. He cares about me, but my problems are mine to solve. \\n\\nI\\'m not saying your parents are on drugs. I\\'m not saying their problems are tantamount to being on drugs.  I\\'m saying, whatever problems they have, are their own. It\\'s possible for you to care, and not feel responsible;  to care, and to not seek solutions.  To care, and do nice things, and be helpful and be a good person, and allow the person you care for to solve their own problems. \\n\\n\\n'],\n",

       " array([\"&gt;The problem is that first i hate my personality, and second i really can't.\\n\\nI think you should accept who are first. You should accept and love your personality. There is nothing wrong with it. \\n\\nI say this because you can't force change. If you try to be something your are not you just feel alienated and bad. Changes if you want to make them must be gradual, you need experience in doing things different.\\n\\nTry not to internalize either. \\n\\n&gt;I do not do any illegal drugs, but i use legal drugs them in an addictive manner; I am addicted to caffeine. I take, though don't abuse, 50mg of zoloft which doesn't really do much.\\n\\nSo half the world. To be honest there is nothing wrong with addiction unless it really bugs you. People paint and ugly picture for addiction yet still drink coffee every morning. But if it troubles you to stop you either need to burn out your addiction or drop it cold turkey or some combination of both. \\n\\n&gt;I am to nervousness to ask for help because for some stupid reason i have an ego which i am protecting or something.\\n\\nDon't think about it just ask. Try stop thinking about ego and id as well you are using them as excuses to not do things. \\n\\n&gt;I have apathy towards all the wrong things. I do not care about disagreeing withs someone and arguing against them. I don't care about the people who got stuck in the cave in Chili or the victims in Darfore. I don't care about other peoples suffering. I do care about other peoples judgement of me. I am a selfish and i hate it but it is what i am like now. \\n\\nHonestly there is nothing wrong with thinking this way its in fact normal.. Remember how I said life is eternal suffering?  You see no matter what you do there will always be some poor saps somewhere suffering from something and because of it its completely natural not to care. You and your problems are more important than the problems of the world that's how it is. There is nothing wrong with being selfish and stop thinking that there is.  Getting what YOU want is always selfish even what you want is to help people out in darfur or something. \\n\\nSee capitalist society runs on people selfish and greed for the good of all. There is no altruism because whatever you do will eventually benefit you in some way. \\n\\n&gt;The thing that i hate most about myself is that I am completely dominated by demon and feel that i can't to disregard what he is saying. I am controlled by addiction and that demon voice i have very little freewill of my own.\\n\\nIt does sound more and more like a mental problem. But I what you to know that all of this is up in your head. They are illusions and thoughts that arent real. Becoming a willful person that can override these things takes practice but can be accomplished. Set small goals for your self everyday that turn into big ones so you can simply ignore anxiety and fear. Do things that are uncomfortable to you until they become comfortable. \",\n",
       "        'From said essay:\\n\\n&gt;For instance, if we suffer very great bodily pain, or if the pain lasts a long time, we become indifferent to all other troubles: our recovery is what we desire most dearly. In the same way, great mental suffering makes us insensible to bodily suffering: we despise it. Nay, if it outweighs the other, we find it a beneficial distraction, a pause in our mental suffering. And so it is that suicide becomes easy; for the bodily pain that is bound up with it loses all importance in the eyes of one who is tormented by excessive mental suffering. This is particularly obvious in the case of those who are driven to commit suicide through some purely morbid and discordant feeling. They have no feelings to overcome; they do not need to rush at it, but as soon as the keeper who looks after them leaves them for two minutes they quickly put an end to their life.\\n\\nThat strikes a chord.  I\\'ve endured, if not \"great\", but at least significant physical pains at points in my life, and they never lead to thoughts of suicide.  Feelings of rage and violence at times, but never suicide.  And I have experience the pleasurable distraction from mental discord that physical pain can bring--i.e., cutting.\\n\\nBut, the rest of the essay seems to be mostly concerned with arguing against the civil criminalization of suicide, and the moral demonization of suicide in the churches.  Ideas that, personally, I\\'ve moved beyond years ago--but I presume others may find the discussion elucidating.',\n",

This cluster of symptoms ([syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome)) was named, described and classified as one of the [mood disorders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_disorder) in the 1980 edition of the [American Psychiatric Association](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psychiatric_Association)\\'s [diagnostic manual](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders). The term \"depression\" is ambiguous. It is often used to denote this syndrome but may refer to other mood disorders or to lower mood states lacking [clinical significance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_significance). Major depressive disorder is a disabling condition that adversely affects a person\\'s family, work or school life, sleeping and eating habits, and general health. In the United States, around 3.4% of people with major depression commit [suicide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide), and up to 60% of people who commit suicide had depression or another mood disorder. \\n\\n&gt;====\\n\\n&gt;[**Image**](http://i.imgur.com/Zp56llE.jpg) [^(i)](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vincent_Willem_van_Gogh_002.jpg)\\n\\n---\\n\\n^Interesting: [^Depression ^\\\\(mood)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_\\\\(mood\\\\)) ^| [^Psychotic ^depression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotic_depression) ^| [^Antidepressant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant) ^| [^List ^of ^people ^with ^major ^depressive ^disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_with_major_depressive_disorder) \\n\\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cfk3stv) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cfk3stv)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/) ^| [^flag ^a ^glitch](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/autowikibot&amp;subject=Glitched comment report&amp;message=What seems wrong: (optional description goes here\\\\)%0A%0A---%0A%0AReply no. 64160:%0Ahttp://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1yfoax/my_girlfriend_is_depressed_and_i_dont_know_how_to/cfk3sqq)'],\n",
